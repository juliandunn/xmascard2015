# 2015 Nerdy Christmas Card

A tradition I started last year is to send a nerdy, letterpressed
Christmas card to friends and co-workers I worked closely with
during the year.

This year's card is written in Rust. My colleague @irvingpop has
posted a picture of the card as well as the output if you type it
in: https://twitter.com/irvingpop/status/680591498799255554
